Our coachbuilding heritage stretches back to 1959, when craftsmen first applied their expertise to bespoke Bentley commissions. Today, Mulliner operates across three pillars: Classic, for the restoration and care of heritage vehicles; Collections, for limited-edition masterpieces; and Coachbuilt, for truly singular visions. Every commission begins with a conversation—your aspirations interpreted by artisans whose skills have no parallel in the modern automotive world. Leathers sourced from specific regions. Veneers matched to your existing furniture. Paint mixed to capture a particular sunset. At Mulliner, limitations exist only in the imagination. The result is not merely a motor car, but a legacy destined to be treasured for generations.",
