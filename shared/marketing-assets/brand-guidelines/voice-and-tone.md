# Bentley Motors Brand Voice Guide

## Brand Essence

Bentley Motors represents the pinnacle of British luxury automotive craftsmanship, where over a century of handcrafted excellence meets contemporary innovation. Every Bentley is a statement of refined taste—a grand tourer that transforms every journey into an extraordinary experience. We do not merely manufacture motor cars; we create objects of desire, sanctuaries of comfort, and expressions of individual distinction.

## Voice Characteristics

### Confident Authority
Bentley speaks with quiet confidence. We state excellence as fact, not as a claim to be debated. Our heritage and craftsmanship speak for themselves.

**Do:** "Each Continental GT requires 130 hours of handcraftsmanship."
**Don't:** "We believe we make the best cars in the world!"

### Sophisticated Elegance
Our language is elevated without being inaccessible. We choose words that resonate with refinement and precision.

**Do:** "The hand-selected hide adorns the interior with understated opulence."
**Don't:** "The leather looks really expensive and fancy."

### Sensory & Evocative
We invite audiences to feel, not just see. Our copy engages multiple senses—the scent of leather, the weight of the door, the whisper of the engine.

**Do:** "Settle into quilted leather that yields to your form, surrounded by the subtle warmth of hand-polished veneer."
**Don't:** "Our seats are comfortable and the wood trim looks nice."

### Heritage-Forward
We honour our past whilst embracing the future. Our century of excellence informs everything we create, yet we continuously evolve.

**Do:** "A century of expertise refines every stitch."
**Don't:** "We've been around for 100+ years."

### Invitational, Not Commanding
We extend invitations to experience, not demands to act. Our audience chooses Bentley; we do not pressure them.

**Do:** "Begin your extraordinary journey."
**Don't:** "Buy now before it's too late!"

Bentley's voice remains consistent, but tone adapts to context:

| Performance | Assured, Thrilling | "600 brake horsepower, delivered with effortless composure." |
| Lifestyle | Aspirational, Evocative | "Where will your next extraordinary journey take you?" |
| Sustainability | Pioneering, Responsible | "Redefining luxury for a new era of mindful motoring." |

- Use discount or value language ("affordable," "value for money," "deal")

This is the difference between manufacturing and craftsmanship. One produces products. The other creates objects with soul.
